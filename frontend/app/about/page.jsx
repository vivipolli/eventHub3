            question: "What is EventHub3?",
            answer: "EventHub3 is a Web3 platform that revolutionizes event management and attendance through blockchain technology. We provide a seamless way for organizers to create events with NFT tickets and certificates, while attendees can collect and showcase their event experiences as digital assets."
        },
        {
            question: "How do NFT tickets work?",
            answer: "NFT tickets are unique digital assets stored on the blockchain. When you purchase a ticket, you receive an NFT that serves as your entry pass. This NFT can also function as a collectible, proof of attendance, and may include special perks or access determined by the event organizer."
        },
        {
            question: "Do I need a crypto wallet to use EventHub3?",
            answer: "Yes, you'll need a compatible crypto wallet to interact with our platform. We support various wallets including MetaMask, Hiro Wallet, and others. The wallet allows you to purchase tickets, store your NFTs, and interact with the blockchain aspects of our platform."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I resell my NFT tickets?",
            answer: "Yes, one of the benefits of NFT tickets is that they can be transferred or resold. However, event organizers may set specific rules or royalties for secondary sales. All transactions are transparent on the blockchain, reducing fraud and unauthorized reselling."
        },
        {
            question: "What blockchain does EventHub3 use?",
            answer: "EventHub3 is built on the Stacks blockchain, which provides security, scalability, and low transaction costs while leveraging Bitcoin's security. This ensures your digital assets are secure and transactions are reliable."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I create an event as an organizer?",
            answer: "To create an event, you need to connect your wallet, register as an organizer, and use our intuitive event creation interface. You can customize your event details, ticket types, pricing, and special NFT features. Our platform handles the blockchain integration, making it easy even for those new to Web3."
